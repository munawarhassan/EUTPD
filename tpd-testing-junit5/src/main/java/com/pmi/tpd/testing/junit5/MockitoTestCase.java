  /**
   * Creates a spy of the real object. The spy calls <b>real</b> methods unless
   * they are stubbed.
   * <p>
   * Real spies should be used <b>carefully and occasionally</b>, for example when
   * dealing with legacy code.
   * <p>
   * As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>: Object
   * oriented programming is more less tackling
   * complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects.
   * How does partial mock fit into this
   * paradigm? Well, it just doesn't... Partial mock usually means that the
   * complexity has been moved to a different
   * method on the same object. In most cases, this is not the way you want to
   * design your application.
   * <p>
   * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: dealing with
   * code you cannot change easily (3rd
   * party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.) However, I
   * wouldn't use partial mocks for new,
   * test-driven & well-designed code.
   * <p>
   * Example:
   *
   * <pre>
   * List list = new LinkedList();
   * List spy = spy(list);
   *
   * // optionally, you can stub out some methods:
   * when(spy.size()).thenReturn(100);
   *
   * // using the spy calls &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt; methods
   * spy.add(&quot;one&quot;);
   * spy.add(&quot;two&quot;);
   *
   * // prints &quot;one&quot; - the first element of a list
   * System.out.println(spy.get(0));
   *
   * // size() method was stubbed - 100 is printed
   * System.out.println(spy.size());
   *
   * // optionally, you can verify
   * verify(spy).add(&quot;one&quot;);
   * verify(spy).add(&quot;two&quot;);
   * </pre>
   *
   * <h4>Important gotcha on spying real objects!</h4> 1. Sometimes it's
   * impossible to use
   * {@link Mockito#when(Object)} for stubbing spies. Example:
   *
   * <pre>
   * List list = new LinkedList();
   * List spy = spy(list);
   *
   * // Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty)
   * when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn(&quot;foo&quot;);
   *
   * // You have to use doReturn() for stubbing
   * doReturn(&quot;foo&quot;).when(spy).get(0);
   * </pre>
   *
   * 2. Watch out for final methods. Mockito doesn't mock final methods so the
   * bottom line is: when you spy on real
   * objects + you try to stub a final method = trouble. What will happen is the
   * real method will be called *on mock*
   * but *not on the real instance* you passed to the spy() method. Typically you
   * may get a NullPointerException
   * because mock instances don't have fields initiated.
   * <p>
   * See examples in javadoc for {@link Mockito} class
   *
   * @param object
   *               to spy on
   * @return a spy of the real object

   * <p>

   * setup but the test methods can override
   * it. Please note that overridding stubbing is a potential code smell that

   * and more readable</b> (especially when stubbing consecutive calls).
   * <p>
   * Here are those rare occasions when doReturn() comes handy:
   * <p>
   * 1. When spying real objects and calling real methods on a spy brings side
   * effects
   *
   * <pre>
   * List list = new LinkedList();
   * List spy = spy(list);
   *
   * // Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty)
   * when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn(&quot;foo&quot;);
   *
   * // You have to use doReturn() for stubbing:
   * doReturn(&quot;foo&quot;).when(spy).get(0);
   * </pre>
   *
   * 2. Overriding a previous exception-stubbing:
   *
   * <pre>
   * when(mock.foo()).thenThrow(new RuntimeException());
   *
   * // Impossible: the exception-stubbed foo() method is called so RuntimeException is thrown.
   * when(mock.foo()).thenReturn(&quot;bar&quot;);
   *
   * // You have to use doReturn() for stubbing:
   * doReturn(&quot;bar&quot;).when(mock).foo();
   * </pre>
   *
   * Above scenarios shows a tradeoff of Mockito's ellegant syntax. Note that the
   * scenarios are very rare, though.
   * Spying should be sporadic and overriding exception-stubbing is very rare. Not
   * to mention that in general
   * overridding stubbing is a potential code smell that points out too much
   * stubbing.

   * validateMockitoUsage() <b>explicitly validates</b> the framework state to
   * detect invalid use of Mockito. However,
   * this feature is optional <b>because Mockito validates the usage all the
   * time...</b> but there is a gotcha so read
   * on.
   * <p>
   * Examples of incorrect use:
   *
   * <pre>
   * // Oups, someone forgot thenReturn() part:
   * when(mock.get());
   *
   * // Oups, someone put the verified method call inside verify() where it should be outside:
   * verify(mock.execute());
   *
   * // Oups, someone has used EasyMock for too long and forgot to specify the method to verify:
   * verify(mock);
   * </pre>
   *
   * Mockito throws exceptions if you misuse it so that you know if your tests are
   * written correctly. The gotcha is
   * that Mockito does the validation <b>next time</b> you use the framework (e.g.
   * next time you verify, stub, call
   * mock etc.). But even though the exception might be thrown in the next test,
   * the exception <b>message contains a
   * navigable stack trace element</b> with location of the defect. Hence you can
   * click and find the place where
   * Mockito was misused.
   * <p>
   * Sometimes though, you might want to validate the framework usage explicitly.
   * For example, one of the users wanted
   * to put validateMockitoUsage() in his &#064;After method so that he knows
   * immediately when he misused Mockito.
   * Without it, he would have known about it not sooner than <b>next time</b> he
   * used the framework. One more benefit
   * of having validateMockitoUsage() in &#064;After is that jUnit runner will
   * always fail in the test method with
   * defect whereas ordinary 'next-time' validation might fail the <b>next</b>
   * test method. But even though JUnit
   * might report next test as red, don't worry about it and just click at
   * navigable stack trace element in the
   * exception message to instantly locate the place where you misused mockito.
   * <p>
   * <b>Built-in runner: {@link MockitoJUnitRunner}</b> does
   * validateMockitoUsage() after each test method.
   * <p>
   * Bear in mind that <b>usually you don't have to validateMockitoUsage()</b> and
   * framework validation triggered on
   * next-time basis should be just enough, mainly because of enhanced exception
   * message with clickable location of
   * defect. However, I would recommend validateMockitoUsage() if you already have
   * sufficient test infrastructure
   * (like your own runner or base class for all tests) because adding a special
   * action to &#064;After has zero cost.
